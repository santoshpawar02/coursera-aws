User Authentication: Users need valid credentials (username and password) to log into the application.
API Calls: The application running on Amazon EC2 must authenticate API calls to Amazon S3 for data access, requiring proper credentials.
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): IAM manages user credentials and permissions within the AWS account, allowing for unique IAM users instead of using the root user for administration.
Authentication vs. Authorization:
Authentication verifies user identity.
Authorization determines what actions a user can perform after logging in.
IAM Policies: These are JSON documents that define permissions for users or groups, allowing for granular control over AWS resources.
Best Practices: It's recommended to set up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the root user and create IAM users with appropriate permissions.
