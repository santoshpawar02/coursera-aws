When you create an AWS account, the email address you use becomes the root user, which has unrestricted access to all resources in your account.
It's crucial to protect the root user to prevent unauthorized access, as it can lead to severe consequences, such as data loss or unexpected charges.
Single-factor authentication (just a password) is not enough for security. It's recommended to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the root user, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring a unique code in addition to your password.
You should avoid using the root user for everyday tasks and instead create IAM users for regular access.


Authentication and Authorization in AWS:

Authentication: This is the process of verifying a user's identity, typically using a combination of an email address and password. It answers the question, "Are you who you say you are?" Other methods include token-based authentication and biometric data.

Authorization: Once authenticated, authorization determines what actions a user can perform within AWS, such as reading, editing, or deleting resources. It answers, "What actions can you perform?"
AWS Root User:

The AWS root user is the initial identity created with complete access to all AWS services and resources. It has two sets of credentials: an email/password for the AWS Management Console and access keys for programmatic requests.
Best Practices for AWS Root User:

Use a strong password, avoid sharing credentials, and do not use the root user for everyday tasks. It's advisable to disable or delete access keys associated with the root user.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):

MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring two or more authentication methods. It combines something you know (like a password) with something you have (like a one-time passcode).
Supported MFA Devices:

AWS supports various MFA mechanisms, including virtual MFA apps, hardware devices, and U2F security keys.
