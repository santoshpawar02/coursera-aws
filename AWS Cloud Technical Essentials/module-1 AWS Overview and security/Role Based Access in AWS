IAM Roles vs. IAM Users: 

IAM users have static credentials (username, password, access key ID, and secret access key).
IAM roles do not have static credentials; they provide temporary credentials that are programmatically acquired and automatically rotated.
Signing AWS Requests: 

AWS API calls must be signed for authentication. IAM roles help EC2 instances sign requests to services like S3 without needing static IAM user credentials.
Creating IAM Roles: 

You can create roles in the AWS console, assign permissions (like S3 and DynamoDB access), and use them for various AWS services.
Federated Users:
IAM roles can also be used for external identity providers, allowing existing users to access AWS without creating individual IAM users.


Lock Down the AWS Root User: 

Do not share root user credentials.
Consider protecting root user access keys.
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the root account.
Follow the Principle of Least Privilege: 

Grant only the necessary permissions for specific tasks.
Start with minimal permissions and add more as needed.
Use IAM Appropriately: 

IAM secures access to AWS resources by managing users, groups, and roles.
It is not for website authentication or protecting operating systems.
Use IAM Roles When Possible: 

Roles provide temporary credentials that expire, making them easier to manage than long-term user credentials.
Consider Using an Identity Provider (IdP): 

An IdP can manage employee identities, reducing the need for multiple IAM users across AWS accounts.
Consider AWS IAM Identity Center:
It allows users to sign in with a single credential for multiple AWS accounts and applications, simplifying user management
