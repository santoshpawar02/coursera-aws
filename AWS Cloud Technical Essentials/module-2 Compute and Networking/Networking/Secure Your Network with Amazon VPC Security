securing a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS. Here are the key points:

Network Access Control Lists (ACLs): 

Act as a firewall at the subnet level.
Control traffic entering and leaving subnets.
Default configuration allows all traffic, but can be customized (e.g., allowing only HTTPS traffic).
Network ACLs are stateless, meaning both inbound and outbound rules must be defined.
Security Groups: 

Firewalls at the EC2 instance level.
Block all inbound traffic by default but allow all outbound traffic.
Must be configured to allow specific inbound traffic (e.g., HTTP and HTTPS).
Security groups are stateful, allowing responses to traffic without needing to modify inbound rules.
Configuration Options:
You can use default settings for convenience or customize for added security.
Both tools are essential for filtering network traffic effectively.



Here are two real-world scenarios where security groups can be applied effectively:

Web Application Hosting:

Scenario: You are hosting a web application on an EC2 instance.
Application of Security Groups:
Create a security group that allows inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS) to enable users to access the website.
Allow outbound traffic to all ports so that the instance can send responses to users.
This setup ensures that only web traffic can reach the instance while keeping it secure from other types of traffic.
Database Access:
Scenario: You have a database running on a separate EC2 instance that needs to be accessed by your application server.
Application of Security Groups:
Create a security group for the database instance that allows inbound traffic only from the security group associated with the application server on the specific port (e.g., port 3306 for MySQL).
This restricts access to the database, allowing only the application server to communicate with it, enhancing security.
