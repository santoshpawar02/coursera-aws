networking and Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in AWS. Key points include:

Default VPCs: AWS automatically creates default VPCs in every region, allowing users to quickly launch EC2 instances and access applications over the internet.
Security Considerations: Resources in default VPCs are exposed to the internet, which can pose security risks.
Custom VPCs: The course will guide you on how to build a custom VPC, which offers enhanced security and more controlled internet access compared to default options.
Importance of Networking: Understanding networking is crucial as it forms the basis of most AWS architectures, even if you are using other compute services like AWS Lambda.




Networking Definition: Networking connects computers globally, allowing them to communicate. An example is the AWS global infrastructure, which uses data centers, Availability Zones, and Regions.

Networking Basics: Similar to sending a letter, networking requires three key pieces of information:

The message (payload)
Sender's address (From)
Recipient's address (To)
IP Addresses: Each computer has a unique IP address, similar to a home address, which is represented in binary format (0s and 1s).
IPv4 Notation: IP addresses are typically shown in decimal format, grouped into octets (8 bits each), separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
CIDR Notation: Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation specifies a range of IP addresses. It starts with an IP address followed by a slash and a number indicating fixed bits. For example, 192.168.1.0/24 indicates the first 24 bits are fixed, allowing for 256 addresses.



CIDR notation is used to define the size of your network and the range of IP addresses available for your resources. Here’s how you can apply CIDR notation in AWS:
VPC Creation: When creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), you specify a CIDR block (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16). This defines the range of IP addresses for the VPC.
Subnetting: You can create subnets within your VPC using CIDR notation. For example, if your VPC is 192.168.0.0/16, you might create a subnet with a CIDR block of 192.168.1.0/24, which allows for 256 IP addresses.
Security Groups and Network ACLs: CIDR notation is also used in security groups and network access control lists (ACLs) to specify which IP addresses are allowed or denied access to your resources.
Elastic IPs: When allocating Elastic IP addresses, you can specify CIDR ranges to manage public IP addresses effectively.


CIDR notation directly affects network size in AWS by determining the number of available IP addresses within a specified range. Here’s how it works:
Fixed Bits: The number after the slash (e.g., /24) indicates how many bits are fixed in the IP address. The more bits that are fixed, the fewer addresses are available for use. For example:
/24: 256 total IP addresses (2^8) - 1 for the network address and 1 for the broadcast address, leaving 254 usable addresses.
/16: 65,536 total IP addresses (2^16) - 1 for the network address and 1 for the broadcast address, leaving 65,534 usable addresses.
Smaller CIDR Notation: A smaller number (e.g., /28) means a smaller network size, providing fewer IP addresses (16 total, with 14 usable).
Larger CIDR Notation: A larger number (e.g., /8) means a larger network size, providing more IP addresses (16,777,216 total, with 16,777,214 usable).
AWS Limits: AWS has limits on the size of VPCs and subnets, so understanding CIDR notation helps you design your network architecture effectively to fit within these limits.
