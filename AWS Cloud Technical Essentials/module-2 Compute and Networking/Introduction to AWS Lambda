Summary of AWS Lambda:

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code in response to triggers without managing servers.
You create a Lambda function by uploading your code, which runs when a specified trigger occurs (e.g., HTTP requests, file uploads to Amazon S3).
Lambda functions are scalable and run in a managed environment, meaning AWS handles maintenance and scaling.
You can choose the programming language, memory, CPU allocation, and permissions for your function.
Lambda is designed for short tasks (under 15 minutes) and is not suitable for long-running processes.
You are billed only for the compute time used, rounded to the nearest millisecond.
An example use case is resizing images uploaded to S3, where a Lambda function is triggered upon an image upload to resize it and save it in a different location.
