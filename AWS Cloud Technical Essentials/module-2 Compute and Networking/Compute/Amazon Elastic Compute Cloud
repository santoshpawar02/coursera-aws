Amazon EC2 instances, which provide flexibility and control in the cloud. Key points include:

Provisioning: You can easily create one or multiple instances and only pay for what you use.
Operating Systems: AWS supports various operating systems, and you select one using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which includes configurations and pre-installed applications.
Instance Types: Different instance types are available based on compute, memory, and storage needs, allowing you to optimize for specific applications.
Resizing: EC2 instances can be resized easily, enabling you to adapt to changing requirements.
Business Impact: The flexibility and low cost of EC2 allow businesses to innovate quickly by testing configurations without the constraints of traditional hardware.


Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a web service that provides secure and resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing users to provision virtual servers known as EC2 instances.
Users can create and manage EC2 instances through various interfaces, including the AWS Management Console and Command Line Interface (CLI).
To launch an EC2 instance, you need to define:
Hardware specifications: CPU, memory, network, and storage.
Logical configurations: Networking location, firewall rules, authentication, and operating system.
Amazon Machine Image (AMI): This is a pre-configured template that includes the operating system and software needed to launch an EC2 instance. It simplifies the server setup process.
The relationship between AMIs and EC2 instances is similar to a recipe and a cake; the AMI defines the instance, while the EC2 instance is the live application of that definition.
AMIs can be reused to create multiple instances with the same configurations, saving time and reducing errors.
AMIs can be found in various categories, including Quick Start AMIs, AWS Marketplace AMIs, My AMIs, and Community AMIs.
