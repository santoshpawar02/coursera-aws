importance of compute capacity for businesses, highlighting the challenges of managing on-premises servers, such as high costs, long setup times, and inflexibility. It contrasts this with the Compute as a Service model offered by AWS, which simplifies the process by providing pre-configured, secure data centers and servers ready for use.

Key points include:

On-premises computing requires significant time and investment.
AWS provides a more efficient way to access compute resources.
The course will focus on Amazon EC2 and explore other compute options like serverless compute and containers.


Understanding Servers in the context of AWS. Here are the key points:

Servers are essential for hosting applications, handling HTTP requests, and responding to clients.
Common HTTP servers include:
Windows: Internet Information Services (IIS)
Linux: Apache HTTP Web Server, Nginx, Apache Tomcat
To run an HTTP server on AWS, you need to select a compute service from the AWS Management Console.
There are three main types of compute options in AWS:
Virtual Machines: Emulate physical servers (e.g., Amazon EC2).
Container Services
Serverless Computing
Understanding Amazon EC2 is crucial as it serves as the foundation for many AWS compute services.
