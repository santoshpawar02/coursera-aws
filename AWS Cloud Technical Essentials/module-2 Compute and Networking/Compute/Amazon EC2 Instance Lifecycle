Amazon EC2 instance lifecycle. Here are the key points:

Provisioning and Termination: EC2 allows you to provision instances on demand and terminate them when no longer needed, charging you only for running instances.
Instance States:
Pending: The instance is booting up after being launched from an AMI.
Running: The instance is active, and you are charged for it.
Reboot: Similar to rebooting a laptop.
Stop: Powers down the instance, allowing you to restart it later.
Stop-Hibernate: Saves the state to memory, allowing for a quick resume without a full boot.
Terminate: Permanently deletes the instance, similar to throwing a laptop into the ocean. Data is lost unless backed up.
Cost Management: You are charged only for instances in the running or stopping state. You can stop instances when not in use to save costs.



EC2 Instance Configuration: After selecting an operating system, you need to configure the instance type, network, and storage based on your application's demands and user base size.

Instance Components: EC2 instances consist of virtual processors (vCPUs), memory, network, and sometimes storage and GPUs. The instance type indicates the performance and capacity.

Instance Families: Different families are optimized for various workloads:

General Purpose: Balanced resources for diverse workloads.
Compute Optimized: High-performance processors for compute-bound applications.
Memory Optimized: Fast performance for memory-intensive applications.
Accelerated Computing: Uses hardware accelerators for efficient processing.
Storage Optimized: High IOPS for large data sets.
Networking: Instances are placed in the default Amazon VPC, which is public. For security, custom VPCs should be used as you gain experience.

High Availability: It's recommended to use multiple instances across different Availability Zones to ensure application reliability.

Instance Lifecycle: Instances transition through states (pending, running, stopped, terminated) with specific actions affecting billing and data retention.

Pricing Options:
On-Demand: Pay for capacity without long-term commitments.
Reserved Instances: Discounted rates for long-term commitments.
Spot Instances: Use unused capacity at a significant discount, but may be interrupted.
