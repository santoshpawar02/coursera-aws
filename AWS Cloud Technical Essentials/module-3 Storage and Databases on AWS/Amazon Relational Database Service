Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), which simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of relational databases. Key points include:

Creating a Database: The process starts in the Amazon RDS dashboard, where you can choose the "Easy create" option for standard best practices or "Standard create" for more control.
Database Engines: Common engines include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora, which is optimized for AWS and offers high performance.
Instance Configuration: You can select instance size and type, with options for free tier eligibility.
High Availability: RDS can be configured for Multi-AZ deployments, allowing for automatic failover and data replication between primary and secondary instances.
Operational Ease: RDS reduces the complexity of database management, making it easier to operate databases with lower overhead.
