DynamoDB Overview: It is a serverless NoSQL database that allows you to create standalone tables without managing underlying infrastructure.
Data Organization: Data is stored in items with attributes. You can have varying attributes for different items in the same table.
Scalability and Performance: DynamoDB is designed to be massively scalable and offers millisecond response times, making it suitable for applications with many users.
Schema Flexibility: Unlike relational databases, DynamoDB does not require a rigid schema, allowing for more flexibility in data storage.
Use Cases: It is particularly useful for datasets with variations and high access rates, where traditional SQL databases may struggle.
Table Creation: The process of creating a table in DynamoDB involves designating unique identifiers for items, such as an employee ID.

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that offers fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. Key features include:

Administrative Ease: Offloads tasks like hardware provisioning, setup, replication, and scaling.
Data Storage: Allows creation of tables to store and retrieve any amount of data, with the ability to scale throughput capacity without downtime.
Core Components:
Tables: Collections of items (e.g., a "People" table for contact information).
Items: Groups of attributes uniquely identifiable within a table (e.g., each person in the "People" table).
Attributes: Fundamental data elements within items (e.g., PersonID, LastName).
Security: Offers encryption at rest for protecting sensitive data.
DynamoDB is designed to maintain high availability and data durability by automatically replicating data across multiple Availability Zones.

<!--      What would happen if you didn't use primary keys in DynamoDB?      -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

If you don't use primary keys in DynamoDB, the following issues would arise:

No Unique Identification: Each item in a table must be uniquely identifiable. Without a primary key, you cannot distinguish between items, leading to potential data conflicts and ambiguity.

Data Retrieval Issues: Primary keys are essential for querying data. Without them, you cannot efficiently retrieve specific items, making data access cumbersome and slow.

Inability to Enforce Data Integrity: Primary keys help maintain data integrity by ensuring that no two items can have the same key. Without them, duplicate entries could occur, leading to data inconsistency.

Performance Degradation: DynamoDB is optimized for primary key access. Not using them would hinder the database's performance, as it relies on keys to quickly locate and manage data.
In summary, primary keys are crucial for the effective functioning of DynamoDB, ensuring unique identification, efficient data retrieval, and maintaining data integrity.
