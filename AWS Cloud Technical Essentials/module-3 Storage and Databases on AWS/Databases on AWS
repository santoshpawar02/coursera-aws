employee directory application being built, which tracks employee data such as name, location, job title, and badges. Key points include:

The application allows for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting employees.
Data will be stored in a database, specifically using Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS).
Relational databases are commonly used across industries, and RDBMS helps manage these databases.
You can run databases on Amazon EC2, but this requires managing the database engine and server tasks.
Using Amazon RDS simplifies operations as AWS handles maintenance tasks like patching and upgrades, allowing you to focus on database creation and optimization.

History of Enterprise Databases: Choosing a database used to be simpler, often selecting a relational database without fully understanding the use case. Since the 1970s, relational databases have been the most common choice.

Relational Database: Organizes data into tables with rows (records) and columns (attributes). Relationships between tables are established through common columns, forming a logical schema.

Relational Database Management System (RDBMS): Allows for the creation, updating, and administration of relational databases. Common examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. SQL is used for querying data.

Benefits of Relational Databases:

Joins: Understand relationships between data.
Reduced redundancy: Store data in one place and reference it elsewhere.
Familiarity: Widely used and understood by technical professionals.
Accuracy: Adheres to the ACID principles for data integrity.
Use Cases: Ideal for applications with stable schemas, such as ERP and CRM systems.

Managed vs. Unmanaged Databases on AWS:
Unmanaged: You manage the database on EC2, while AWS handles the infrastructure.
Managed: AWS manages both the infrastructure and the database setup, providing convenience but less control.
