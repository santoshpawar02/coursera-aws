importance of monitoring in cloud solutions, particularly in AWS. Here are the key points:

Operational Awareness: It's crucial to monitor services to identify issues before users report them, ensuring a better user experience.
Monitoring as a Process: Monitoring involves collecting metrics, logs, and network traffic to understand system performance.
Metrics and Statistics: Metrics are data points (e.g., CPU utilization), while statistics are metrics monitored over time.
Data Collection: Different services generate various metrics, such as CPU usage from EC2 instances and connection counts from databases.
Baseline Establishment: Collected data helps establish a baseline for normal operations, allowing for alerts when deviations occur.
Centralized Monitoring: A good monitoring solution consolidates data, enabling proactive management and automated responses to issues.
Amazon CloudWatch: This tool is highlighted as a solution for monitoring AWS services, providing a centralized view of metrics from various components.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

To establish a baseline for system performance, you can follow these steps:

Collect Historical Data:

Gather metrics over a period of time (e.g., CPU usage, memory utilization, network traffic).
Use monitoring tools like Amazon CloudWatch to automate data collection.
Identify Normal Operating Conditions:

Analyze the collected data to determine typical performance levels during different times (e.g., peak vs. off-peak hours).
Look for patterns and trends in the data.
Define Performance Metrics:

Choose key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to your application (e.g., response time, error rates).
Ensure these metrics align with user expectations and business goals.
Set Thresholds:

Establish acceptable ranges for each metric based on historical data.
Define thresholds that, when exceeded, will trigger alerts for potential issues.
Regularly Review and Update:
Continuously monitor performance and adjust the baseline as necessary, especially after significant changes (e.g., new deployments, infrastructure changes).

When operating a website like the Employee Directory Application on AWS you may have questions like:
How many people are visiting my site day to day?
How can I track the number of visitors over time?
How will I know if the website is having performance or availability issues?
What happens if my Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance runs out of capacity?
Will I be alerted if my website goes down?

monitoring in the context of operating a website, specifically using AWS services. Here are the key points:

Monitoring Definition: The act of collecting and analyzing data about the operational health and usage of IT resources.
Importance of Monitoring:
Provides insights into visitor traffic and performance issues.
Helps identify operational problems like resource over-utilization or security threats.
Metrics: Data points collected from resources (e.g., CPU utilization, network performance) that help evaluate system health.
Types of Metrics: Different AWS resources generate different metrics (e.g., EC2 instances track CPU and memory, while S3 tracks object size and request counts).
Benefits of Monitoring:
Proactive issue resolution.
Improved performance and reliability.
Recognition of security threats.
Data-driven business decisions.
Cost optimization.
Amazon CloudWatch: A service that centralizes monitoring data, allowing for anomaly detection, alerting, and performance visualization.
